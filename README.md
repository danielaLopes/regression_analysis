# Regression Analysis

## Linear regression heteroscedasticity analysis
* Uses the Wine UCI dataset to predict several characteristics of wine using the alcohol percentage by applying simple linear regression.
* Uses the White's test to perform Heteroscedascity analysis with different features.

## Z-score normalization
* Uses the Wine UCI dataset and applies ZCA and PCA Whitening to standardize the scale of features.

## Multi linear regression
* Uses the Pima Diabetes dataset to apply multi-feature linear regression to predict the blood sugar values.
* Uses multiple visualization techniques to analyse the features.
* Performs feature selection with OLS, permutation ranking with Random Forest Regressor, and residual analysis (linearity, normality, multicollinearity, and homoscedascity).

## Logistic regression
* Uses the Pima Diabetes dataset to apply logistic regression to predict diabetes patients.
